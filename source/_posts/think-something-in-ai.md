Perhaps AI will continue to improve significantly in the future.

Specifically, advanced AI like DeepSeek is transforming the world.

We can achieve remarkable things through AI.

I'm uncertain about what the future holds.

But I'm determined to adapt by leveraging AI tools.

For example:

* Coding tasks
* Article writing
* Knowledge sharing
* And more

By 2025, I believe AI capabilities will advance exponentially.

I plan to keep learning programming languages like Go, frameworks like Swoole and Hyperf,

focusing on high-performance computing.
